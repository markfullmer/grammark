- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS/JS library
- [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)

=======================
If you just want your own version of Grammark on your server, head on over to https://github.com/markfullmer/grammark/tree/angular-distribution.
Clone the files, or download the zip into a directory on your server.

You should now have a fully-functional grammar checker!
